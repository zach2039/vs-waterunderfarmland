Water Under Farmland
=================

Overview
--------

Allows water directly under farmland to be a valid moisture source. 

Does not allow water to irrigate diagonally from below; water must be directly below the farmland.


Known issues
--------

- Incompatible with mods that patch `BlockEntityFarmland.GetNearbyWaterDistance` or implement a custom farmland BlockEntity.
